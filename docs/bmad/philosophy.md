# UI Module: Philosophy, Purpose, and Design Principles

**Date:** December 23, 2025

## 🎯 Purpose and Core Responsibilities

The `UI` module is the dedicated component responsible for managing and standardizing the application's User Interface (UI) elements, components, and overall presentation logic. Its core purpose is to provide a consistent, reusable, and efficient foundation for frontend development across all other modules. Given the minimalist nature of its `ServiceProvider`, the module is designed to:

1.  **Modular UI Component Discovery:** Serve as the central mechanism for discovering and registering modular Blade components, Livewire components, and other UI-related assets that can be reused throughout the application. The `getComponentViewPath()` method, leveraging `GetModulePathByGeneratorAction`, is key to this.
2.  **Encapsulation of UI Logic:** Act as the dedicated container for all common UI patterns, styles, scripts, and interactive elements, enforcing a clear separation of concerns for the presentation layer.
3.  **Module Registration:** Register itself with the application, allowing its UI resources (views, components, assets) to be discovered and integrated into the overall system.
4.  **Leverage `Xot` Base Functionality:** By extending `XotBaseServiceProvider`, it implicitly inherits and utilizes the foundational bootstrapping, configuration, and architectural patterns provided by the `Xot` module, ensuring consistency and adherence to the project's modular structure.

## 💡 Philosophy & Zen (Guiding Principles)

The `UI` module, while concise in its service provider, embodies several key design principles:

*   **Component-Driven UI Development:** The module's philosophy strongly advocates for a component-driven approach to UI development. It aims to make individual UI elements (like buttons, forms, navigation items) reusable, easily discoverable, and independently manageable, fostering consistency and accelerating frontend development.
*   **Separation of Concerns for the Presentation Layer:** It strictly enforces the principle of separating UI-related concerns from business logic. This makes the UI layer more independent, easier to manage, test, and evolve without impacting the application's core functionalities.
*   **Architectural Conformity and Consistency (`Xot` Alignment):** The module's adherence to `XotBaseServiceProvider` signifies its commitment to the project's overarching modular architecture. It operates in harmony with other modules, benefiting from `Xot`'s established patterns without needing to redefine them.
*   **"Politics" (UI Standardization and Governance):** The "politics" of this module revolve around establishing and enforcing UI standardization across the entire application. It dictates the patterns for creating, organizing, and consuming reusable UI components, thereby ensuring a consistent and predictable user experience and streamlining frontend governance.
*   **"Religion" (User Experience as the Ultimate Priority):** The "religion" here is a fundamental belief in the paramount importance of a consistent, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing user experience. The module is built on the principle that a well-structured and thoughtfully designed UI is key to user satisfaction, adoption, and long-term retention.
*   **"Zen" (Harmonious and Predictable User Interface):** The "zen" of the `UI` module is to provide a harmonious, predictable, and delightful user interface. It aims for a state where users can effortlessly interact with the application, finding familiarity and ease of use in every interaction. For developers, it fosters a calm environment where new features can be built confidently using a consistent set of UI components, creating an intuitive and visually appealing digital environment.

## 🤝 Business Logic (Supporting Role - User Experience & Branding)

The `UI` module's business logic is primarily supportive, focusing on **enhancing the application's user experience and presentation**. It significantly aids the core business by:

*   **Brand Consistency:** Ensuring a unified and consistent look and feel across the entire application, which is crucial for reinforcing brand identity and recognition.
*   **Development Efficiency and Speed:** Providing a library of reusable UI components and established patterns that accelerate frontend development, reduce duplication, and decrease time-to-market for new features and updates.
*   **Improved User Adoption and Retention:** A well-designed, intuitive, and consistent UI contributes significantly to user satisfaction, leading to higher adoption rates, increased engagement, and better user retention.
*   **Accessibility Foundation:** By standardizing UI components and design patterns, it provides a solid foundation for building accessible interfaces that cater to a wider range of users.

Thus, the `UI` module is a fundamental enabler of a high-quality user experience, translating the application's functionalities into an engaging and effective visual form.

## 🤖 Integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The `UI` module, as the guardian of the application's user interface, can significantly benefit from integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. MCPs offer enhanced capabilities for inspecting, managing, and debugging UI components and assets, aligning perfectly with `UI`'s philosophy of component-driven development and harmonious user interfaces.

### Alignment with `UI`'s Philosophy:

*   **Component-Driven UI Development:** MCPs provide tools to inspect and validate UI component registrations, view paths, and associated assets. Filesystem MCP is crucial for verifying the physical presence and structure of Blade components and their styles/scripts.
*   **Separation of Concerns for the Presentation Layer:** By providing intelligent access to UI resources, MCPs can help ensure that UI logic remains distinct from business logic, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.
*   **Developer Experience (DX) Enhancement:** For frontend developers, quickly inspecting loaded UI components, debugging Livewire interactions, or validating asset loading via Laravel Boost or Filesystem MCP can significantly accelerate development and debugging cycles. Playwright/Puppeteer MCPs are invaluable for visual regression testing and UI automation.
*   **"Zen" (Harmonious and Predictable User Interface):** MCPs contribute to this zen by making UI component management more transparent, verifiable, and manageable, leading to a calmer and more confident development and operational environment for the user interface.

### Key MCPs for `UI`'s Operations:

1.  **Laravel Boost (MCP)**: Invaluable for inspecting loaded Blade components, Livewire components, and their associated data. It can help debug interactive UI elements and ensure correct data binding.
2.  **Filesystem (MCP)**: Essential for navigating UI component directories, inspecting Blade files, CSS, JavaScript assets, and verifying path resolution.
3.  **Memory (MCP)**: Can store and retrieve best practices for UI component design, common frontend pitfalls, and architectural decisions related to UI frameworks, enhancing knowledge transfer and consistency.
4.  **Git (MCP)**: Aids in reviewing changes to UI components, styles, scripts, or layout files, ensuring visual consistency and adherence to design systems.
5.  **Playwright/Puppeteer (MCP)**: Crucial for end-to-end testing of UI components, visual regression testing, and verifying responsiveness across different devices and browsers, directly supporting a high-quality user experience.

By leveraging these MCPs, the `UI` module can ensure its critical role in delivering an engaging and effective user interface is more efficient, verifiable, and transparent, ultimately contributing to a superior user experience.
# UI Module: Design System & Components

> **Reusable Form/Table Components** — Filament-integrated, consistent styling, multi-module usage.

---

## Zen

**"Component library is DRY. No copy-paste UI logic."**

UI is not a domain; it's a toolkit for all modules.

---

## Quick

### Models (4)
- **Category** — Component/asset taxonomy
- **Collection** — Grouped components
- **FieldOption** — Enum-like picker (for form/table dropdowns)

### Components (26 total)

**Forms (15)**
- AddressField, Children, EnumSelect, RangeInput, SectionCollapsible, TagsInput, etc.

**Tables (11)**
- AddressColumn, DummyActionsColumn, GroupColumn, KeyValueColumn, SlugColumn, etc.

### Pattern
```
Module needs form field for address
  ↓
Import UI.AddressField
  ↓
Use in Filament::form()
  ↓
Automatic i18n, validation, styling
```

### Traits (1)
- **TableLayoutTrait** — Grid/list layout switching

---

## Integration

- **Every module** uses UI components
- **Filament** abstraction layer
- **Styling** centralized (Tailwind, dark mode)

---

## Best/Bad

✓ Component reusability (no duplication)
✓ Consistent UX across modules
✓ Type-safe prop passing
❌ Custom form fields (use UI components)

---

## Parity: Forms ↔ Tables

**Rule**: For each form component, there exists a table column counterpart.
- `AddressField` ↔ `AddressColumn`
- `EnumSelect` ↔ `EnumColumn`

Tracked in: `docs/form-column-parity.md`

---

## Roadmap

- Component documentation (Storybook-like)
- Dark mode variants
- Accessibility audit (WCAG AA)
- Responsive breakpoint testing

Reusable components, design system, and patterns for Filament, Folio, and Volt across all 47 modules.

### First Principle

> **One component library, infinite uses. Filament for admin, Folio+Volt for public, DRY everywhere.**

UI components are shared, not reinvented per module. Patterns are consistent. Base classes from Xot are extended, not bypassed.

### The Rules

#### 1. Xot-First Components, Never Filament Direct

All UI components extend Xot base classes:
```php
// Resources
class MyResource extends XotBaseResource { }

// Widgets
class MyWidget extends XotBaseChartWidget { }

// Pages
class MyPage extends XotBasePage { }
```

**Never** import Filament classes directly into resources.

**Why:** Filament upgrades change in one place (Xot). Direct Filament usage locks module to Filament version.

#### 2. Folio + Volt for Public Sites, Filament for Admin

- **Public pages**: `resources/views/pages/` (Folio routes), Volt components for interactivity
- **Admin**: Filament resources, pages, widgets in `Modules/{Mod}/app/Filament/`

No controllers in public routes. No direct `routes/web.php` entries for Folio pages.

**Why:** Folio is file-based and scales with page count. Filament is declarative and scales with resource count. Clean separation.

#### 3. Theme-Aware Styling, Not Hard-Coded Colors

Components read from `config()` or theme files:
```blade
<div class="bg-{{ config('app.theme.primary') }}">
```

**Never** hardcode Tailwind color classes.

**Why:** Multi-tenant apps have different brands. Light/dark mode switching requires theme abstraction.

#### 4. Reusable Components Over Repetition

Before writing a component:
1. Check `Modules/UI/app/Filament/Components/`
2. Check sibling modules for similar patterns
3. Extract to UI if it's used in 2+ places

**Why:** Three similar components = unmaintainable. Extract early.

#### 5. i18n for Every Label

All labels come from translation files:
```php
->label(trans('ui::button.save'))
->options(trans('ui::enum.status.*'))
```

**Never** hardcode English text in components.

**Why:** Folio sites serve global audiences. Label extraction is expensive if embedded.

#### 6. Blade Components as Fragments, Volt as Stateful

- **Blade**: Simple markup (buttons, badges, cards) — no state
- **Volt**: Complex interactivity (forms, searches, filters) — stateful

```blade
<!-- Simple: Blade component -->
<x-ui::button>Save</x-ui::button>

<!-- Complex: Volt component -->
<livewire:search-products />
```

**Why:** Volt adds request overhead. Blade components are fast. Use the right tool.

#### 7. PHPStan L10 + Strict TypeScript

All components are type-checked:
- PHP: no `any`, no mixed types
- Blade: no undefined variables
- Volt: no loose property definitions

**Why:** Typos in component props = silent failures. Type safety catches them.

### The Zen of UI

> **See once, reuse forever. Update once, everywhere changes.**

- One button style = everywhere uses it
- One input pattern = all forms consistent
- One widget design = dashboard stays coherent
- Filament version updates = one file changes (Xot)
- Theme changes = config swap, no code changes

### Breaking the Rules

If you think a rule is wrong:
1. **Document the exception** in your module's README
2. **Extract if repeated** — don't duplicate components
3. **Never hardcode colors or text** — always use config/i18n
4. **Never use Filament directly** — extend Xot base
5. **Notify UI maintainers** if a pattern should be core
