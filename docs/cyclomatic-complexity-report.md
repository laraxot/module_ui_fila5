## 🎯 Cyclomatic Complexity Overview

### What is Cyclomatic Complexity?

La complessità ciclomatica è una metrica del software che misura la complessità di un programma.
Viene calcolata contando il numero di percorsi di esecuzione indipendenti attraverso il codice sorgente.

### Interpretation Guidelines

| Complexity | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| 1-10 | ✅ Low | Simple method, low risk |
| 11-20 | ⚠️ Moderate | Consider refactoring |
| 21-50 | 🔴 High | Should refactor |
| >50 | 💀 Very High | Must refactor immediately |

---

## ✅ Excellent!

No methods with high complexity found. All methods have complexity ≤ 10.

## 📈 Complexity Distribution

| Risk Level | Count | Percentage |
|------------|-------|------------|
| ✅ Low (1-10) | 323 | 100.0% |
| ⚠️ Moderate (11-20) | 0 | 0.0% |
| 🔴 High (21-50) | 0 | 0.0% |
| 💀 Very High (>50) | 0 | 0.0% |

## 📐 Statistical Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average Complexity | 1.30 |
| Median Complexity | 1 |
| Maximum Complexity | 8 |

## 💡 Recommendations

✅ **Great job!** This module has excellent code quality with no high-complexity methods.

Continue following best practices:
- Keep methods focused on a single responsibility
- Extract complex logic into separate methods
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
