# Code Coverage: UI

<<<<<<< HEAD
## 2026-09-04 — Concrete models → contracts (UI, User modules)

**Task:** Replace `\Modules\User\Models\Profile` docblock refs with `\Modules\Xot\Contracts\ProfileContract` (12 occurrences in UI).

**Rationale:** Reduce coupling to provider models; enable polymorphism and DI. Contracts are the SSoT for model interfaces.

**Files modified:** `Collection.php`, `FieldOption.php`, `Category.php` (3 files, 9 property-read docblock substitutions).

### Verification

- **PHPStan:** `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse Modules/UI --no-progress` → **[OK] No errors**.
- **PHPMD:** `./tools/phpmd.sh "Modules/UI" text cleancode,codesize,design,naming,unusedcode` → exit 0 (clean).
- **Pest:** `./vendor/bin/pest Modules/UI` → **197 passed, 8 failed, 1 risky** (identical baseline; all failures pre-existing, unrelated to docblock-only changes).
- **Coverage:** No new tests added (docblock-only refactor, zero behavior change); Xdebug not configured.

## 2026-09-04 — app/Services to QueueableAction (no-services-rule)

Task: convert every file under `app/Services/` to `Spatie\QueueableAction\QueueableAction` under `app/Actions/`, no exceptions on destination folder.

**Census** (`find Modules/UI/app/Services -name "*.php"`): exactly one active file, `app/Services/UIService.php` (plus pre-existing `.bak` archives from an earlier, never-fully-executed migration attempt on 2026-07-13/07-16 — `ComponentService.php.bak`, `ThemeService.php.bak`, `UIService.php.bak`, `Map/NullMapService.php.bak`, `Map/NullGeocodingService.php.bak` — out of scope, not `.php`, left untouched).

| File | Kind | Classification reasoning | Action taken |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app/Services/UIService.php` | A (already-thin-facade) | Single static method `asset(string $asset): string` whose entire body was `return app(AssetAction::class)->execute($asset);` — a 1:1 passthrough to the already-existing `Modules\Xot\Actions\File\AssetAction`. Grep across the whole `Modules/` and `Themes/` trees (`UIService::asset`, `Modules\UI\Services\UIService`, `use Modules\UI\Services`) found **zero call sites** anywhere in production code. Matches the task's own "already thin facade" carve-out (per `Modules/Tenant/app/Services/TenantService.php` precedent): the hard work (real logic already lives in `AssetAction`) was done; there is no logic left to move into a new UI-owned Action, and creating a wrapper Action whose `execute()` body is only `app(AssetAction::class)->execute(...)` would just recreate a redundant pass-through one level down. This exact reasoning had already been reached (but never actually executed — the file was still live) in `Modules/UI/docs/wiki/concepts/ui-services-support-to-actions.md` and `no-app-support-queueable-actions.md`. | Deleted via `git rm app/Services/UIService.php`. No callers to update. Any future caller should use `app(\Modules\Xot\Actions\File\AssetAction::class)->execute($path)` directly. |

Note: `UIServiceProvider` (in `app/Providers/`) is a Laravel `ServiceProvider` subclass, an unrelated framework construct, not an `app/Services/*Service` business-logic class — out of scope for this rule.

- PHPStan (`Modules/UI`, `clear-result-cache` before each run): baseline **0 errors** → final **0 errors**.
- PHPMD (`./tools/phpmd.sh Modules/UI text ../docs/phpmd.ruleset.xml`): crashes on the whole module with `No node to visit provided for visitAnonymousClass` — pre-existing, documented tooling limitation (see `quality-tooling-real-commands` memory), not caused by this change. No new PHP file was added to scope for a per-file retry (deletion only).
- Pest (`./vendor/bin/pest Modules/UI/tests -c Modules/UI/phpunit.xml --no-coverage`): 197 passed, 8 failed, 1 risky, 109 skipped. All 8 failures are pre-existing and unrelated to `UIService`/`AssetAction` (`TestCase::expectMethod()` Mockery `CompositeExpectation` type mismatch, a missing `ui::components.render.blocks.ui::empty` view, an `OpeningHoursColumn` assertion) — none reference the removed class.

Story: `docs/stories/ui-services-to-actions.story.md`.

## 2026-09-04 — Mixed type reduction

**Task:** reduce native `mixed` type-hint usage in `Modules/UI` where a more specific type
is genuinely knowable, per project convention ("dove possibile", best-effort, not 100%).

### Scope surveyed

- `grep -rnE '\bmixed\b' Modules/UI --include="*.php"` (excluding `tests/`): 36 files, 103
  occurrences (native type-hints + docblocks).
- Most occurrences are legitimately `mixed` and were left untouched:
  - Filament closure contracts (`formatStateUsing`, `afterStateHydrated`,
    `dehydrateStateUsing`, `beforeStateUpdated`) — the callback signature is dictated by
    Filament/vendor code (`Closure(mixed $state): ...`); narrowing would fight the framework
    contract, not add safety.
  - `Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\ValidationRule::validate(string $attribute, mixed
    $value, Closure $fail)` in `OpeningHoursRule` — vendor interface signature.
  - Docblock `array<string, mixed>` / `array<int, array<string,mixed>>` for genuinely
    heterogeneous payloads: Blade view-data arrays, Filament form/block/state config,
    `Spatie\LaravelData` `UserData::$settings`, icon-set config read via reflection from
    `BladeUI\Icons\Factory` (`GetAllIconsAction`), dynamically-resolved per-model calendar
    Action results (`UserCalendarWidget::normalizeEventsArray/normalizeFormSchema` — the
    concrete Action class is resolved at runtime from `$this->type`, so its return shape is
    not statically knowable).
  - `app/Filament/Forms/Components/LocationSelector.php` and
    `app/Livewire/Components/Map/InteractiveMap.php` were skipped entirely: both are under
    the active `docs/chat/ui-geo-boundary-lock.md` coordination lock (do-not-touch).

### Changes made (4 files, 5 occurrences)

- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/SelectState.php`: `combineStateOptions()` key-mapper
  closure narrowed from `fn (mixed $key): string` to `fn (int|string $key): string` —
  the input is `array_keys($states)`, and PHP array keys are always `int|string`, never
  truly `mixed`.
- `app/Filament/Tables/Columns/SelectStateColumn.php`: same `array_keys()` key-mapper
  narrowing in `combineStateOptions()`.
- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/IconPicker.php`: same `array_keys($optsRaw)` key-mapper
  narrowing.
- `app/Forms/Components/RadioCardSelector.php`: `normalizeCardRow()` docblock
  `@param array<mixed, mixed> $item` corrected to `@param array<array-key, mixed> $item`
  (array keys are never `mixed`; only `int|string`/`array-key`).

Value-side closures over `array_values($states)` etc. were deliberately left as `mixed`
where the array's value type is itself genuinely heterogeneous (Filament state values can
be scalars, enums, or model-derived data) — confirmed by reading each call site before
touching it, per the "no unjustified narrowing" rule.

### PHPStan

- Baseline (before any edit): `./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse Modules/UI --no-progress
  --error-format=table` → **[OK] No errors**.
- After edits: **[OK] No errors** (unchanged, 0 → 0).

### PHPMD (informational)

`./tools/phpmd.sh <4 changed files> text ../docs/phpmd.ruleset.xml` →
`CyclomaticComplexity`/`NPathComplexity` on `SelectState::setUp()` and
`SelectStateColumn::setUp()` — pre-existing debt on the whole `setUp()` method body, not
introduced by this diff (only a closure parameter type changed, no logic/branches added).

### Pest

`./vendor/bin/pest Modules/UI/tests -c Modules/UI/phpunit.xml --no-coverage` →
**8 failed, 1 risky, 109 skipped, 197 passed (645 assertions)**, 160.77s. All 8 failures
are pre-existing and unrelated to this diff: `Modules\UI\Tests\TestCase::expectMethod()`
`TypeError` (`Mockery\CompositeExpectation` vs `Mockery\Expectation`, a test-harness
signature mismatch in `tests/TestCase.php:47`, unrelated to any file touched here) and a
`View [ui::components.render.blocks.ui::empty] not found` error in `UiGapCloser100Test`
(pre-existing view-resolution issue in `Blocks.php`, not touched by this diff). None of the
failing tests exercise `SelectState`, `SelectStateColumn`, `IconPicker`, or
`RadioCardSelector`.

Note: this run's counts (8 failed/197 passed) differ from the earlier 2026-01-17 dump above
(76 failed/42 passed) — different date, different pre-existing suite state; not a
regression caused by this task (verified no file touched by this diff appears in the
failure list).

### Coordination note

`git status --short` at task start showed a large pre-existing dirty working tree (removal
of leftover `<<<<<<< HEAD` / `>>>>>>> laraxot/dev` merge-conflict markers across ~300 docs
files and ~25 `app/` files, e.g. `GetUserDataAction.php`), not related to this task and not
made by this session. Per the "var-override-before-git-log-check" / live-WIP guidance,
those pre-existing changes were left untouched (not reverted, not staged) and only the
files listed above were touched/committed by this session.

## 2026-09-04 — Quality gate closure (phpmd MissingImport cleanup)

**Task:** BMAD quality-gate closure pass for `Modules/UI` (Build+Measure): phpstan baseline,
phpmd fixes, pest run, coverage doc. `Modules/UI/docs/stories/quality-gate-2026-09-04-ui.story.md`.

### php -l sweep

`find Modules/UI -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \;` → clean, zero syntax errors across the
whole module.

### PHPStan

- Baseline (`clear-result-cache` then `analyse Modules/UI --no-progress`): **[OK] No errors**.
- After the 5 fixes below: **[OK] No errors** (0 → 0, no regression).
- Mid-session one `analyse` invocation crashed at the Laravel bootstrap step (`Typed property
  Modules\Xot\Datas\ComponentFileData::$name must not be accessed before initialization`,
  raised from `Modules\Xot\Actions\Blade\RegisterBladeComponentsAction`). Root-caused (not
  fixed, out of scope — a different module, no lock held on it) to a concurrent, uncommitted
  session actively rewriting `Modules/Xot/app/View/Components/_components.json` at that exact
  moment: the file's mtime moved twice during this session (legacy `class_name/comp_name/comp_ns`
  schema instead of the current `name/class/ns` schema at one point), and `git status --short`
  in `Modules/Xot` showed hundreds of unrelated modified files at the same time. Re-running
  `analyse Modules/UI` ~3 minutes later, after that file's mtime stabilized, was clean again.
  Not a `Modules/UI` regression; not touched or worked around (no edits made outside `Modules/UI`).

### PHPMD

`./tools/phpmd.sh Modules/UI/app text ../docs/phpmd.ruleset.xml`: **64 → 58 findings** (real
fixes below; the remaining 58 were read individually and are either framework-mandated
signatures, external-data-key naming, or parent-class-inherited property names — see notes).

**Fixed (5× `MissingImport`, mechanical, zero behavior change — FQCN `throw new \X(...)` /
`new \X(...)` replaced with a `use` import + unqualified name):**

- `app/Actions/Block/ResolveLocalizedBlockDataAction.php:48` — `\UnexpectedValueException`.
- `app/Actions/Icon/GetAllIconsAction.php:25` — `\ReflectionClass` (this edit also
  incidentally dropped `execute()`'s reported CyclomaticComplexity 16→13 and NPath 4260→612 —
  a PHPMD counting artifact of one fewer FQCN token, not a real logic change).
- `app/Datas/ThemeMetadataData.php:36` — `\InvalidArgumentException`.
- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/EnumSelect.php:202,206` — `\InvalidArgumentException` (both
  occurrences, one `use`).
- `app/Filament/Forms/Components/InlineDatePicker.php:275` — `\RuntimeException`.

**Left undone, documented (not a suppression — no `@SuppressWarnings` added anywhere):**

- `CyclomaticComplexity`/`NPathComplexity`/`ExcessiveMethodLength`/`ExcessiveClassComplexity`
  on `GetUserDataAction::execute()`, `GetAllIconsAction::execute()`,
  `IconStateColumn::setUp()`, `IconStateGroupColumn::stateClass()`, `IconStateSplitColumn`,
  `SelectStateColumn::setUp()`, `SelectState::setUp()`, `InlineDatePicker::generateCalendarData()`:
  pre-existing debt already documented in `docs/chat/module-ui-sync-and-quality-validation.md`
  and `docs/chat/quality-gates-03-exec-coordination.md` (previous sessions, not introduced by
  any recent diff). A real fix needs a deliberate extract-method refactor of each `setUp()`/
  `execute()` body with dedicated behavior-preserving tests as a safety net; `IconStateColumn`,
  `IconStateGroupColumn`, `IconStateSplitColumn`, `SelectStateColumn` have **no existing test
  file** (checked: only `GetUserDataAction`, `GetAllIconsAction`, `InlineDatePicker` do), so a
  same-session mechanical complexity refactor without first writing characterization tests
  would violate "verification before done" — out of scope for this pass, flagged for a
  dedicated follow-up story.
- `UnusedFormalParameter`/`CamelCaseParameterName` on `$_context`, `$_livewire`, `$_component`,
  `$_state`, `$_ability`, `$_attribute` (blocks/columns/policy/rule): underscore-prefixed is
  this codebase's existing convention for "required by a Filament/framework callback signature,
  intentionally unused" — removing the parameter breaks the interface, renaming away from the
  underscore contradicts the convention. Not a real defect.
- `UnusedFormalParameter` on `UserCalendarWidget`'s `$start/$end/$allDay/$view/$resource` and
  `AddressField`'s `$key`: framework-required event-handler/callback signatures (FullCalendar
  JS event bridge, Filament state-hydration callback) — same reasoning.
- `UnusedFormalParameter $calendarClass` on `ApplyCalendarToPanelAction::execute()`: already
  self-documented in the class docblock as an intentional no-op stub during the Filament v4
  migration (`Saade\FilamentFullCalendar` not yet v4-compatible) — real fix is an external
  package upgrade, out of scope here.
- `CamelCaseParameterName`/`CamelCasePropertyName`/`LongVariable` on `SliderData`'s
  `desktop_thumbnail`/`mobile_thumbnail`/`*_webp`/`short_description`/`action_text`,
  `SliderDataCollection::$slider_data`, `TestChartWidget::$max_height`: verified these
  snake_case names are read by exact name in Blade views (`swiper.blade.php`,
  `notifications_list.blade.php`) and in named-constructor-argument test calls
  (`tests/Unit/Datas/UIDatasCoverageTest.php`) — renaming is a real API change requiring
  coordinated edits to every call site plus (per Spatie Data mapping semantics) `#[MapInputName]`
  attributes if any JSON/DB source still supplies snake_case keys; out of scope for a
  quality-gate pass, flagged for a dedicated follow-up story if desired.
- `CamelCasePropertyName` on `RouteServiceProvider`/`UIServiceProvider`'s `$module_dir`/
  `$module_ns`: verified these are declared with the exact same snake_case names in the parent
  `Modules\Xot\Providers\XotBaseRouteServiceProvider` (a different module/repo, not locked by
  this task) — they are property overrides, not free naming choices; renaming here would just
  create new unrelated properties instead of overriding the parent's.
- `BooleanArgumentFlag` on `EnumSelect::icons()/htmlLabels()` and
  `LocationSelector::required()/searchable()`: standard Filament fluent-builder boolean-toggle
  method pattern (`->icons(false)`, mirrors dozens of vendor Filament components) — not a real
  SRP violation in this idiom, changing it breaks the established fluent API convention used
  throughout the module.
- `ElseExpression` (3 occurrences) and `ShortVariable $to` (`RedirectWidget`, already carries a
  pre-existing `@SuppressWarnings("PHPMD.ShortVariable")` docblock that PHPMD is not honoring
  for properties in this ruleset/version — pre-existing, not this session's doing, `$to` is a
  public config key read by name from JSON block config, same external-key-naming reasoning
  as `SliderData` above): stylistic, low value/high risk to touch without dedicated tests.

phpinsights is **not installed** in this repo (removed — incompatible with Pest 5, see
second-brain memory `pest5-incompatible-con-phpinsights`); not run, not available.

### Pest

`./vendor/bin/pest -c Modules/UI/phpunit.xml --no-coverage` → **8 failed, 1 risky, 109
skipped, 197 passed (645 assertions)**, 211.62s — identical counts to the same-day baseline
recorded above (2026-09-04 — Mixed type reduction entry): confirms no regression from the
`MissingImport` fixes. The 8 failures are the same pre-existing ones already catalogued above
(`BindingResolutionException` on `Illuminate\Contracts\View\Factory`/`translator` in
`GroupColumnTest`, a locale-format mismatch in `OpeningHoursColumnTest`, 3×
`TestCase::expectMethod()` Mockery type mismatch, 1 missing-view error in
`UiGapCloser100Test`) — none reference any of the 5 files touched by this session.

No coverage-raising test was added: the 5 fixes were mechanical FQCN→`use`-import
substitutions with zero behavior change (verified via identical pest pass/fail counts
before/after), so there is no real gap or dead code this pass uncovered to justify a new
test per the "no fake tests just to move the number" rule. Coverage baseline stands as
documented in the entry above (no driver installed — pass/fail counts are the tracked proxy
in this module, same as prior entries).
=======
## Sessione 2026-09-07 — PHPStan zero (story 01.UI-phpstan-fix)

**PHPStan `Modules/UI` (`--no-progress --memory-limit=-1`, cache pulita):**

- Prima: **4 errori reali** (`method.staticCall`), tutti in `tests/Unit/UiGapCloser100Test.php` e
  `tests/Unit/UiHighestMissCoverageTest.php`, causati da una modifica in-progress (non mia,
  gia' presente nel working tree condiviso a inizio sessione) che converte
  `Modules\UI\Filament\Blocks\{Category,Contact,Image,Navigation,Page,Post,Slider}::getFormSchema()`
  da `public static function` a `public function`, allineandosi alla convenzione repo-wide
  gia' in uso su `XotBaseResource`/`XotBasePage`/`XotBaseWidget` (`$this->getFormSchema()`,
  mai `Class::getFormSchema()`). I test chiamavano ancora il metodo in modo statico.
- Dopo: **0 errori**.
- Fix: aggiornate le chiamate nei due file di test da `Block::getFormSchema()` a
  `(new Block())->getFormSchema()`. Nessun `@phpstan-ignore`, nessuna baseline, nessun
  `mixed` introdotto, `phpstan.neon` non toccato.

**Pest `Modules/UI/tests -c Modules/UI/phpunit.xml --no-coverage`:**

- Risultato: **197 passed, 8 failed, 1 risky, 109 skipped (672 assertions)**, 498s.
- Questo numero coincide esattamente con l'ultima baseline onesta gia' documentata nella
  story `7.13.mixed-type-reduction` (chiusa 2026-09-04: "197 passed, 8 failed pre-esistenti,
  109 skipped, 1 risky"). La sezione precedente di questo file (sotto, datata 2026-09-06)
  riportava "6 failed, 199 passed" ma senza elenco completo dei 6 — quel numero risulta
  essere uno snapshot parziale/transitorio di un'altra sessione, non la baseline stabile.
- Nessuno degli 8 fallimenti riguarda i file toccati in questa story (i due file di test
  sopra) ne' la describe/test specifica che ho modificato al loro interno. Elenco completo:
  1. `GroupColumnTest` (x3 casi) — `BindingResolutionException` su `translator` (setup
     container, pre-esistente).
  2. `OpeningHoursColumnTest` — mismatch locale (`Mon chiuso` atteso, `Lun chiuso` trovato).
  3. `GetUserDataActionTest` — `QueryException`, tabella `permissions` mancante sul DB di
     test `workorder_user` (problema di schema DB test, non di codice — vedi memoria
     `project_test_db_missing_migrations_blocks_feature_tests`).
  4. `UiBasePolicyBehaviorTest` — `TypeError` su mock `hasRole()` (Mockery closure vs bool).
  5. `UiGapCloser100Test > Blocks and Block render resolution` — view
     `ui::components.render.blocks.ui::empty` non trovata (diversa dal test che ho toccato
     nello stesso file, "Image block ratio helpers").
  6. `UiRemainingCoverage100Test` — stessa `QueryException` su `permissions`.
- Non "aggiustato a caso": nessuno di questi e' nello scope PHPStan di questa story (sono
  DB/locale/mock, non type-error), e sono documentati anche nelle story precedenti.

**PHPMD** (`Modules/Xot/phpmd.ruleset.xml`, unico ruleset UI-compatibile disponibile —
UI non ha un `phpmd.ruleset.xml` proprio): stesso set di violazioni pre-esistenti gia'
descritto sotto (nessuna sui 2 file toccati).

**PHPInsights** (`--min-quality=80 --min-complexity=80 --min-architecture=80 --min-style=80`):
scoped a un singolo modulo fallisce nativamente con `ComposerNotFound` in
`ForbiddenSecurityIssues` (bug tooling noto, vedi memoria
`project_phpinsights_composer_lock_scoped_path`). Aggirato con un `--config-path` ephemeral
in `/tmp` che rimuove solo quell'insight (nessuna modifica alla config condivisa del repo).
Risultato: `Code 84.5`, `Complexity 95.3`, `Style 92.8` (tutti ≥ 80), `Architecture 76.5`
(< 80 — gap pre-esistente, causato da uso di trait e setter/proprieta' pubbliche sparsi in
tutto il modulo, non introdotto ne' peggiorato da questa story; fuori scope per un fix
mirato a 4 errori PHPStan).
